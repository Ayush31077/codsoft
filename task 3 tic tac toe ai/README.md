## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Game Logic (`game_logic.py`)
- Board representation and state management
- Move validation and win detection
- Game state tracking and history

### 2. AI Algorithms (`ai_player.py`)
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Recursive search for optimal moves
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimization to reduce search space
- **Strategic Evaluation**: Position-based scoring
- **Difficulty Levels**: Mix of smart and random moves

### 3. AI Difficulty Levels

#### Easy
- Makes completely random moves
- Good for beginners or testing

#### Medium
- 70% smart moves using minimax
- 30% random moves for unpredictability
- Balanced challenge level

#### Hard
- 90% smart moves using minimax
- 10% random moves
- Challenging for most players

#### Unbeatable
- Always makes the optimal move
- Uses full minimax search
- Impossible to beat (best result is a draw)

- **AI vs AI Mode**: Watch two AIs play against each other

## ü§ñ AI Algorithm Details

### Minimax Algorithm
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to find the best move:

```python
def minimax(game, depth, is_maximizing, alpha, beta):
    if game_over:
        return evaluate_position()
    
    if is_maximizing:
        max_eval = -infinity
        for each possible move:
            make_move()
            eval = minimax(game, depth+1, False, alpha, beta)
            undo_move()
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Alpha-beta pruning
        return max_eval
    else:
        # Similar logic for minimizing player
```

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimization technique that reduces the number of nodes evaluated:

- **Alpha**: Best score for maximizing player
- **Beta**: Best score for minimizing player
- **Pruning**: Skip branches that won't affect the final decision

### Strategic Evaluation
The AI evaluates board positions based on:

- **Winning lines**: 3 in a row
- **Blocking moves**: Prevent opponent from winning
- **Strategic positions**: Corners and center
- **Position control**: Number of winning opportunities

## üìä Performance

### AI Decision Times
- **Easy**: < 1ms (random moves)
- **Medium**: 1-10ms (partial minimax)
- **Hard**: 5-50ms (mostly minimax)
- **Unbeatable**: 10-200ms (full minimax)

### Game Complexity
- **Total possible games**: 255,168
- **Optimal game length**: 5-9 moves
- **Perfect play result**: Always draw or win

## üéØ Game Strategies

### For Players vs AI

#### Against Easy AI
- Play aggressively
- Take center and corners
- Create multiple winning opportunities

#### Against Medium AI
- Play strategically
- Focus on blocking AI's winning moves
- Use tactical positioning

#### Against Hard AI
- Play defensively
- Aim for draws
- Avoid obvious mistakes

#### Against Unbeatable AI
- Best possible result is a draw
- Play perfectly to achieve draw
- Any mistake will result in loss

### Optimal Opening Moves
1. **Center (5)**: Most strategic position
2. **Corners (1, 3, 7, 9)**: Good for creating multiple winning lines
3. **Edges (2, 4, 6, 8)**: Least strategic

2. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
3. Verify all files are present
4. Check file permissions

## üéÆ Game Rules

### Standard Tic Tac Toe Rules
1. Players take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 grid
2. First player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
3. If all positions are filled without a winner, the game is a draw
4. X always goes first

### Position Numbering
```
 1 | 2 | 3 
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6 
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9 
```
